Causal Inference Working Group I: Machine Learning Methods for Causal Inference

This group will study the methods in the interface between machine learning and causal inference. 


## Potential topics

Inspired by [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop](http://tripods.cis.cornell.edu/neurips19_causalml/) topic list. 

<ul>
<li>Predicting counterfactual outcomes (e.g., for individual treatment effect estimation) </li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning and Causal Inference (e.g., for dynamic treatment regimes) </li>
<li>Causal transfer learning</li>
<li>Estimation of (conditional) average treatment effects</li>
<li>Policy learning</li>
<li>De-biasing observational data</li>
<li>Causal discovery</li>
<li>Applications on text data (e.g., counterfactual story generation) </li>
<li>Applications in medicine (e.g., personalized treatment, clinical trials, fMRI)</li>
<li>Applications in social sciences and policy evaluation</li>
</ul>

## Potential research ideas

<ul>
<li> Neural machine translation (NMT) approach to time-series counterfactual prediction </li>
<li> Double-robust learning as a multitask learning problem </li>
<li> Counterfactual prediction on observational panel data with continuous-valued treatment</li>
<li> Generated data augmentation approach to de-confounding </li>
</ul>
